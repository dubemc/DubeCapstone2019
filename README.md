## InsulCalc

InsulCalc, the Insulin Calculator for Type 1 Diabetics, was created to have the user input their glucose at a certain time, then get an output of the amount of insulin needed to level that glucose. This product is supposed to help a Diabetic make their levels less varied (i.e. many hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic episodes.) While this is supposed to help with research on Diabetes, it is not a certified medical tool to treat or help with it. 

As someone with a loved one who's diagnosed with Diabetes, I wanted to learn more about the disease while furthering my knowledge on Data Science. I collected my mother's, a Type 1 Diabetic, data, verified it, then put it through a Machine Learning Algorithm in order to see if I could calculate a more accurate insulin dosage to control her glucose levels on a day-to-day basis.
